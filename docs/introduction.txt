# How does it work?
Our team created a game that tests users' reaction speed by clicking on a circle when it turns green.
We allow users to log in or sign up to our website before playing the game to store their information (username, password, and score) in a database.
## Front End 
The front includes reactionGame.js, game.html, index.html, leaderboards.html, and style.css
Our main page is our index.html page, which features the ability to either login to your account or sign up for a profile if you don't already have one. Additionally, you can go to the game page to try it for yourself as a guest, without logging in or signing up.
## Back End 
The back end includes forms.js, database.js, user.db, and server.js
Our API creates a database of users (user.db) that is managed by our server.js file. Input into this database is linked via our form.js file. Our database is created by the database.js file.
## Dependencies
