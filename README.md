in a database and post their scores to a leaderboard.

# Technical Documentation

# HTML & CSS

Our game has three different HTML pages, a homepage, a leaderboard screen and a page to play the game. 
We used bulma to style our website using different classes that we learned from a02 and Bulma documentation.
Additionally, we created a log in and sign up section to input people's usernames and passwords to store
in our database.
